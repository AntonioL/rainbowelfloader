#summary How-to use the PortKit.

= Needed things =

First of all, we need:
  * portkit.php or .exe (check repository)
  * functions.pat (check repository)
  * CG1 from the firmware in which you intend to use the elfloader (named in this tutorial CG1.smg)
  * ElfLoader source code (check repository)
  * ElfLoader Spawner source code (check repository)

= Let's start =

Put portkit.exe or .php and functions.pat in the same folder of CG1.smg.

Now create a file called port.bat (on win) or port.sh (on linux) in this file write:
  * {{{portkit.exe -sf functions.pat CG1.smg}}} if you are in win
  * {{{php ./portkit.php -sf functions.pat CG1.smg}}} if you are in linux

Then run the created file and a file named newlib.sym will be created.

Open the file and check the all functions have been found, if not you will have to look for them.
